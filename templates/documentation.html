                                    application. One thing to note here is that the last two rows in this section can only be edited on the admin page as you
                                    can only add a new nurse schedule or set of time slots in the main application.
									<p>Finally, to the left of these two sections is
                                    the Recent Actions tab, which record the recent actions (such as editing a schedule) that all users have taken on the admin site.</p>

                                    arrow. If you feel that it is convenient, you can click the "Choose All" button to add all permissions or the remove all to remove

                        The python file settings.py is what Django uses to determine the application settings being used.
                        The 'DATABASES' field will need to be changed to specify your database engine (ex: postgresql) and
                        the connection information.

                        <p>
                            This web app was developed using the Pycharm IDE as it already had an excellent interface for building web tools
                            using Django and Python. We chose to use Django with a Python backend because we wished to use new technologies to enhance
                            our skillset and because we felt that Python is very easy to work with. As previously mentioned Python was used for the
                            backend development which includes (but is not limited to) the algorithm for generating a
                            schedule, communicating with the database, customizing the admin site, and grabbing information from the textboxes on
                            the actual website.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the font end we used the classic combination of HTML5 and CSS (enhanced with Bootstrap libraries)
                            to design the web pages and make them aesthetically pleasing. We paired these with Javascript to add functionality to the
                            various links and buttons that were placed on the website. Many of our Javascript functions utilized Ajax to call the various
                            database related functions we had written in Python to either save, delete, or query for data (using Postgressql on Heroku ,
                            SQlite on local host). Ajax was chosen because it makes the page more responsive as it can make a call to the python script without causing a post
                            back of the entire page. We used it solely for calls that interact with the database. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The website itself is (at the time of this writing) hosted on Heroku,
                            which is a cloud server and is a temporary place to use the website until the client is ready to move the web app to one of their own servers.
                            Heroku was chosen because it was very compatible to use with git which was our preferred version control software. To interact with git our
                            team chose to use SourceTree as it is very eay to work with and has a great GUI (in our humble opinions).
