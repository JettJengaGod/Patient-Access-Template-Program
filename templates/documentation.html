                                    you to the password change page, and Log Out which will log the user out and bring the user to the logout page. On
                                    the left side of the page under the AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION bar there are two rows, one for users and one for groups
                                    (a group of users with a set of permissions or traits). By clicking the title “Users” or “Groups”, the admin site will redirect you to the
                                    appropriate pages to edit the current users or groups in the database. Clicking the pencil icon to the far right of

                                    fashion to the section above it. The main differences are that the rows reference to the chemotherapy drugs, nurse schedules
                                    in the system, and Saved Time Slots Inputs, which reference the sets of time slots that you can save and load in the main
                                    application. One thing to note here is that the last two rows in this section can only be edited on the admin page as you
                                    can only add a new nurse schedule or set of time slots in the main application Finally, to the left of these two sections is
                                    the Recent actions tab, which record the recent actions (such as editing a schedule) that all users have taken on the admin site.
                                    One thing to note here is that it does not record the action of logging in  or accessing the site.

                                    schedule, communicating with the database, customizing the admin site, and grabbing information from the textboxes on
                                    the actual website. For the font end we used the classic combination of HTML5 and CSS (enhanced with Bootstrap libraries)
                                    to design the web pages and make them aesthetically pleasing. We paired these with Javascript to add functionality to the
                                    various links and buttons that were placed on the website. Many of our Javascript functions utilized Ajax to call the various
                                    database related functions we had written in Python to either save, delete, or query for data (using Postgressql on Heroku,
                                    SQlite on local host). The website itself is hosted on Heroku, which is a cloud server and is a temporary place to use the website
                                    until the client is ready to move the web app to one of their own servers. Finally, we used git as our version control software so
                                    that all team members could work on the project simultaneously without fear of overwriting or corrupting each other's work.

                    The python file settings.py is what Django uses to determine the application settings being used.
                    The 'DATABASES' field will need to be changed to specify your database engine (ex: postgresql) and
                    the connection information.
