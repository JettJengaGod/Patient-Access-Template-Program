Patient Access Template Program


Background:
Patient driven access is always a concern for our company. We want to maximize our efficiency yet we face a lot of restraints. Nothing in Oncology is cookie-cutter or consistent. That being said, our current system is such that we place patients into a grid and do our best to accommodate pharmacy needs with needed lunch breaks...etc. I created a program using File Maker Pro that determines the true appointment duration necessary based on the patient, not the medication. (You and I may be on the same medication requiring a 2 hour appointment, but I had a reaction and need to slow the rate of infusion...so I need 3 hours) Based on this program, I'm trying to create a template where we can offer the appropriate quantity of each appointment. (Example: 23 30-min appointments, 29 60-min appointments...etc)

Description:

Our current system is such that our schedulers move people around to make the pieces fit. I'd like a smart computer system to have a template in the background so when we know the duration of the appointment, we can offer whatever appointments of that duration we have open to the patient.

A template would look something like this:


I am seeking a computer program that would create the template for me. I could easily enter my known data (how many of each duration of appointment) and based on all the 'rules' set into the program, a template would be generated. Each month, I could input the slight changes in appointment quantity and obtain a new template.

I'm happy to discuss with you further over the phone or make another attempt at explaining using screen shots if necessary. Feel free to call me too at the number below for any clarification. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to participate in your class- I'd even be willing to come show you my exact problem / issue if that would help.
